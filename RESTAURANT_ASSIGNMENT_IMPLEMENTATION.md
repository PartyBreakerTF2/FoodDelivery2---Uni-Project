# Restaurant-Staff Assignment System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive restaurant-staff assignment system that addresses the critical security flaw where restaurant staff could access any restaurant's data. The system now enforces proper business rules where restaurant staff can only access and modify data for their assigned restaurant.

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `restaurant_id` column** to users table for RESTAURANT_STAFF role
- **Added foreign key constraint** linking users.restaurant_id to restaurants.id
- **Created database indexes** for performance optimization
- **Migration script** created and tested: `database/add-restaurant-id-column.sql`

### 2. User Model Enhancement
- **Enhanced User model** with `restaurantId` field and getter/setter methods
- **Updated UserService** database layer to handle restaurant_id column in INSERT/UPDATE operations
- **Added new service methods**:
  - `findStaffByRestaurant(Long restaurantId)` - Find all staff for a specific restaurant
  - `findUnassignedStaff()` - Find restaurant staff not assigned to any restaurant
- **Enhanced row mapper** to safely handle restaurant_id column with backward compatibility

### 3. Security Architecture Overhaul
**RestaurantController Complete Redesign:**
- **`/restaurant/dashboard`** - Now shows only assigned restaurant's data and orders
- **`/restaurant/menu`** - Only displays menu items for staff's assigned restaurant
- **`/restaurant/menu/add`** - Automatically adds items to staff's restaurant (no selection needed)
- **`/restaurant/menu/edit/{id}`** - Added security check to prevent editing other restaurants' items
- **`/restaurant/orders`** - Only shows orders for the assigned restaurant
- **All endpoints** now validate restaurant assignment and redirect with error if unassigned

### 4. Admin User Management
**Enhanced Admin Interface:**
- **Restaurant assignment functionality** with modal dialogs
- **Visual indicators** showing restaurant assignments with color-coded badges
- **Assign/Reassign functionality** for restaurant staff
- **Unassign functionality** to remove restaurant assignments
- **New admin endpoints**:
  - `POST /admin/users/{id}/assign-restaurant` - Assign staff to restaurant
  - `POST /admin/users/{id}/unassign-restaurant` - Remove restaurant assignment

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- **Updated terminology** from "Restaurant Panel" to "Restaurant Staff Panel"
- **Removed restaurant selection** from add menu item form (now auto-assigned)
- **Added restaurant info display** as read-only in forms
- **Enhanced user management table** with restaurant assignment column
- **Added assignment status badges** (Assigned/Unassigned) with color coding
- **Modal dialogs** for restaurant assignment with dropdown selection

### 6. Restaurant Orders Management
- **Created comprehensive orders view** (`restaurant/orders.jsp`)
- **Order status management** with workflow buttons
- **Restaurant information display** in orders view
- **Order statistics dashboard** (pending, confirmed, preparing, delivery counts)
- **Security validation** ensuring staff can only manage their restaurant's orders
- **Order status update endpoint** with proper authorization checks

### 7. Data Integrity & Validation
- **Security checks** prevent staff from accessing other restaurants' data
- **Validation** ensures only RESTAURANT_STAFF users can be assigned to restaurants
- **Error handling** with appropriate user feedback
- **Redirect logic** for unassigned staff with clear error messages

## 🎯 KEY SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before Implementation:
- Restaurant staff could access any restaurant's data
- Controllers used "first restaurant" approach (major security flaw)
- No proper access control for restaurant-specific operations
- Menu items could be added to any restaurant regardless of staff assignment

### After Implementation:
- **Strict access control**: Staff can only access their assigned restaurant
- **Proper authorization**: All operations validate restaurant assignment
- **Data isolation**: Complete separation of restaurant data
- **Security-first approach**: All endpoints check assignment before allowing access
